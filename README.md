# Pantheon
This is a content management system built in *PHP* using *MySQL* database that can be used to create websites similar to WordPress, Drupal or Joomla. *Pantheon* is a framework that I have designed from scratch that can help users create, manage, and modify content on a premade website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.

I have also designed and developed a well thought out, user friendly interface for Pantheon which comes in 4 different themes that the user can switch while using the website.

## Features of Pantheon
- Supports two types of users : Admin & Member. 
- Admins have the ability to:
    1. Add, Update, View and Delete categories on Pantheon.
    2. Add, Update, View and Delete posts on Pantheon.
    3. Moderate comments by member users on all posts.
- Members have the ability to:
    1. Create, Update, View and Delete their own posts on the website.
    2. Members can leave comments on all posts that are published on Pantheon after moderation from Admin roles.
- Posts on Pantheon are accessible by all the visitors and members of the website.
- All posts can be categorised usings tags that can only be added by the Admins that is further used for Internal Search.
- Pantheon has internal search that has been setup so that users can search the whole array of posts on the website through their post titles or tags. 
- Visitors can browse through all the posts or make comments without an account but to create their own posts, they must have an account on Pantheon. 
- Only Users of Pantheon have the access to view the overall statistics of Pantheon which includes total amount of posts, users, comments and categories on the website.
- All visitors/users can browse Pantheon in four different themes.
