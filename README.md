# Pantheon
This is a content management system built in PHP using MySQL database that can be used to create websites similar to WordPress, Drupal or Joomla. Pantheon is a framework that I have designed from scrach that can help users create, manage, and modify content on a premade website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.
